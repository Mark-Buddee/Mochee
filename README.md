Mochee [ MOH-chee ]
Mother of Chess Engines
Designed and written by Buddee890, with inspiration from MisterQueen, and Stockfish.

Mochee is a UCI chess engine written just for fun in C. It evaluates positions based on only material count and simple piece-square-tables, and so relies heavily on an efficient search routine.

Mochee was released as a bot on lichess, go and check it out: https://lichess.org/@/MocheeZero
